This project is more or less a replica of the Mintyn ios mobile application with only a few of the original's feature.

The user interface was built using just programmatic UIKit (no storyboards) and there was adoption of the MVVM architecture to structure the app efficiently. The flow of the app is pretty basic as required and the authentication side can only authenticate one user as there isno database whatsoever for this project, upon running app, the required field for login would have been pre populated so no need to get the credentials. 

This project has certain rooms from improvement as it was developed within a very short amount of time, the test coverage can be improved to cover at least 70% of the total code but time didn't permit that. The user interface could have also been researched upon to fit the required standard also, for example, the tab bar is a custom one and if time permitted, could have been looked into properly as the tab bar in this project is not the best.
